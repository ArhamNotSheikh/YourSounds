    <h1>About YourSounds</h1>
    <P>
  Welcome to YourSounds! Here, your voice steps into the spotlight and instantly transforms into musical tones generated by real instruments. No complicated settings — just say something and hear it come alive.
    </P>

    <h2>Applications</h2>
    <p>
      YourSounds can be used for:
      <ul>
        <li>Creating unique musical compositions</li>
        <li>Exploring the relationship between voice and music</li>
        <li>Learning about sound and pitch in an interactive way</li>
        <li>Just entertaining yourself (ps: Not everything has to be serious and for a reason)</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>
      The magic begins the moment your microphone picks up your voice. ml5.js listens in, extracts the pitch and frequency behind every note you hum or speak, and turns them into clean musical data. From there, Tone.js steps in,using that data to play back your melody on the instrument of your choice, ready for you to tweak the speed, fine-tune the frequency, and make it truly yours.
    </p>

    <h2>The Story</h2>
    <p>
      Being inclined towards music, I've always found myself humming random tones and little melodies, constantly imagining how they would sound on an actual instrument — maybe even turning them into musical samples someday. But I never had the skill to play those ideas on a real instrument, and I knew there were many others just like me. That realisation led to the creation of YourSounds  a space where anyone can walk in with their creativity and instantly turn their voice-driven ideas into musical reality.
    </p>
